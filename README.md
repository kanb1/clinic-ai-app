# Klinika ‚Äì Digital Clinic System

A fullstack **clinic management system** built as part of my bachelor‚Äôs thesis at KEA.  
The platform supports different user roles (admin, doctor, secretary, patient) and combines **administrative workflows** with an **AI assistant** for patient preparation.

üëâ **Live demo (Frontend)**: https://clinic-ai-app.vercel.app/
‚ÑπÔ∏è Use one of the [demo accounts](#4-demo-accounts) to log in.

## Why Klinika?

The project explores how **AI can supplement, not replace, human interaction** in a healthcare setting.  
Patients are supported with an AI chatbot that helps them describe their symptoms in a structured way. Doctors then use these AI-generated notes as a supplement during the consultation ‚Äî improving efficiency without losing the human touch.

## Features

- **AI integration**:
  - Patients can chat with an AI assistant before an appointment to describe symptoms.
  - AI-generated notes are saved in the patient‚Äôs record and visible to the doctor.
  - Doctors can add their own notes alongside AI suggestions, ensuring human oversight.
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with JWT authentication
- **Admin**: manage clinic, doctors, secretaries, and patients
- **Secretary**: handle bookings, availability, and patient messaging
- **Doctor**: see today‚Äôs appointments, view patient history, add notes, prescriptions & test results
- **Patient**: book appointments, chat with AI assistant, view profile & prescriptions
- **Messaging system** (secretary/admin ‚Üî patients)
- **Calendar system** with availability slots, booking flow, and appointment confirmation/cancellation
- **Security measures**:
  - Input validation (manual + backend)
  - JWT with jti to prevent replay attacks
  - Password hashing (bcrypt pre-save middleware)
  - Helmet, CORS, HTTPS
  - Rate limiting
  - Dependabot for dependency security
